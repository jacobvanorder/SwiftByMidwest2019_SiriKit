# Swift by Midwest 2019 SiriKit Shortcuts Example App

_Prerequisites: Built with Xcode 10.2, Swift 5. In order to run on device, you'll need a Apple Developer account._

## Overview

Through this code, I intend to show the various sizes you can implement SiriKit Shortcuts within iOS. The baseline branch contains the starting point for the app and each implementation builds upon that. 

Small: Utilizes the already existing `NSUserActivity` to add a SiriKit Shortcut.

Medium: Adds UI and a quick shortcut to get the next talk from right now.

Large: Implements an Intent Definition file and Intent Extention to answer the question when a particular speaker is speaking while in the background.
