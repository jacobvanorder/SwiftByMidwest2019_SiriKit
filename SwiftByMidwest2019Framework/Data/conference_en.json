But your collections broke, so you added type-erasers. But your “as”-casts broke, so you switched to Any. But then everything broke, so you read about Mirror. And the tears began. Why did it have to be so hard to make an array? \n\nIt doesn’t have to be so hard. But it’s very easy to use the wrong tools to solve the wrong problems. In this session I’ll help you reevaluate what it means to write generic Swift and how to choose the right tools for the job. Whether your goal is reusable view controllers, flexible networking, data-driven UI, effective unit testing, or just the joy of elegant data structures, you’ll learn how to work with Swift and not fight the compiler.",
